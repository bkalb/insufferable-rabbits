            <h3>Fucking hell, these rabbits.</h3>

            <p>They may look innocent, but looks can be deceiving. These repeat offenders are capable of misdeeds that would make your salad spin.</p>

            <p>Though domesticated from a young age, the rabbits known as Mister Sinister and Brünhilde are as wild as they come, known to seriously fuck with your shit... just because they can. They are not to be trusted under any circumstances, no matter how friendly they seem. Friendship is a weakness. They will exploit it.</p>

            <p>The next time you see them roaming the halls of their Chicago apartment, think twice before you engage.</p>
